name: agent-evaluation
description: Generates aeval evaluation assets from a PRD — eval.yaml, dynamic-conversation test cases, and config.yaml — for an agent or an agent extension. Use when the user wants to "evaluate an agent", "generate eval test cases", "create aeval tests", "set up agent evaluation", or update the evaluation after extending an agent.

## How a run works

1. **Read [writing-checks](./references/writing-checks.md) and
   [schemas](./references/schemas.md).** They govern every operation. No file below repeats
   the instruction — assume both are loaded.
2. **Read the operation file** matching the request and follow it. Each names the further
   references it needs.
3. **Resolve `output_dir` once** (see [Paths](#paths)) and write every file under it.
4. **Finish with [validate-and-report](./references/validate-and-report.md).** It writes all
   three files — `eval.yaml`, the test cases, and `config.yaml`. **Nothing reaches disk
   before it runs** — several of its checks change what gets written.

```

```

## The invariants

These hold across every operation. The operation files say how to satisfy them.

**Both artifacts come straight from the PRD.** Neither derives from the other. The eval
requirements say *what must be true*; the test cases say *what situation to put the agent
in*. Write the tests from the source, not from the eval requirements — an eval requirement
is a one-line rule, and the persona, identifiers, and edge cases a scenario needs do not
survive that abstraction.

**Eval requirements and tests must reach parity.** Every eval requirement is covered by at
least one test, and every test covers at least one eval requirement. Totality in both
directions, not a one-to-one mapping. Fix every orphan before writing, usually by adding the
missing eval requirement.

**Every source requirement reaches both artifacts.** Parity is between the two generated
files; this is about the document they came from. Every requirement, acceptance criterion,
milestone condition, and qualifying business metric in the PRD produces **at least one eval
requirement** and is exercised by **at least one test case**. The only exemption is a
requirement with no observable form, recorded as unassertable with a reason. Silence is never
an exemption — an uncovered requirement produces no failing test, only a smaller suite that
passes.

**The budget is per category.** **5 to 10 eval requirements in each of the three categories**
— 5 is the target, so 15 entries is the normal file — and **at least 3 test cases per group,
capped at 15 in total.** Count the eval requirements per category, never as a total: 15
entries sitting 9/4/2 checks what the agent *says* in detail and barely checks what it
*does*, and no total reveals that.

A category short of 5 is usually one that was not mined thoroughly, rather than a PRD that
had nothing to say on it.
[Where the 5 come from](./references/derive-eval-requirements.md#where-the-5-come-from) lists
the recurring obligation types each category carries — the error path, the empty result, the
missing input, the fabrication rule — which PRDs imply constantly and state almost never.
Mine those before concluding a category is thin, and **never invent an entry to reach 5**: a
requirement the source never stated is one the tests must then satisfy, and the agent is
marked down for behaviour nobody asked of it.

**Coverage is bought with checks, not with files.** The budget counts entries, not
assertions. A test case carries as many checks as its scenario supports, so covering one more
requirement is nearly always another check inside an existing scenario rather than another
file. With 15 or more eval requirements and at most 15 tests, most tests carry several
checks — that is the design, not a compromise. Reach for a new test case only when the
*situation* is genuinely different — a different journey, a different failure, a different
adversarial setup. See [the test case
budget](./references/design-test-cases.md#the-budget) and [the eval requirement
budget](./references/derive-eval-requirements.md#the-budget).

**Test cases are dynamic conversations.** One `dynamic_conversation` step each, driven by an
LLM-simulated user. The scenario lives in `user_agent.task_summary`; the assertions live in
the three validation blocks.

**Checks name values, not shapes.** A check that a field is *present* passes against a
response carrying the wrong customer and the wrong amount.

**`mcp-mock.json` is optional, and preferred wherever it exists.** Look for it on either
operation. It carries each tool's name, description, `input_schema`, and deterministic
`mock_response`, so every expected value is knowable while the test is written — which no
other source offers. When it is absent, fall back to what the operation supports: the MCP
translation files for an extension, a `@tool` scan for an agent. Without it, a tool's
**output** assertion describes what the call must return in kind rather than naming a value;
parameters are still asserted exactly. See
[tool-catalog](./references/tool-catalog.md#which-source-applies).

**On an extension, `extension.yaml` is read either way.** It states which tools the extended
agent may call and when it must call them, and no other source answers either question. A
`mcp-mock.json` supplements it; it never replaces it.

**Take the tool source as it stands and stop.** It is the authority on the agent's tools. Do
not open the agent's source to cross-check it, confirm it, or supplement it, and do not read
it "for context" on how a tool behaves. Reading code becomes a tool source **only** in the
agent flow, when no `mcp-mock.json` is found anywhere, via the fallback in
[tool-catalog](./references/tool-catalog.md#fallback-no-mcp-mockjson) — never on an
extension, which does not contain the agent's code to scan.

**Read only the files the operation names.** The inputs are the source document, the tool
source, and — for an extension — the baseline requirements, the base test suite, and the
extension artifacts. Nothing else. Do not walk the agent's implementation, its tests, its
prompts, its dependencies, its notebooks, or its configuration looking for extra signal. It
costs a large amount of context for no gain, and it reliably produces tests asserting
implementation behaviour the source document never asked for, which
[validate-and-report](./references/validate-and-report.md) will then delete.

**A base test suite is read through an index, never whole.** It is the one named input large
enough to exhaust the context on its own. Take `id`, `tags`, and `description` across the
suite, cluster by behaviour, and open in full only what survives triage — see
[extend-eval-scenarios](./references/extend-eval-scenarios.md#3-triage-the-base-test-cases).

**`config.yaml` is outside all of this.** Runtime parameters only. No eval requirements, no
coverage, nothing derived from the source. **Its values are always the defaults** — never
ask the user for them.

**Never ask the user for the test case count or the runtime parameters.** Both have defaults
and both are applied silently. The only questions ever worth asking are the ones that
genuinely block the run: an ambiguous request, or an `output_dir` that nothing determines.

## Files

**Always read**

[writing-checks, how to phrase any judged string, and what must never appear in generated output](./references/writing-checks.md)

**Schemas** — read before writing anything

[schemas, the shape of eval.yaml and the test case files, plus the mandatory tag set](./references/schemas.md)

**Operations — read the one matching the request**

| Request | Read |
|---|---|
| Evaluate an agent, create its test cases, validate before release, monitor it live | [generate-eval-scenarios](./references/generate-eval-scenarios.md) |
| Generate or update the evaluation for an agent extension | [extend-eval-scenarios](./references/extend-eval-scenarios.md) |

If the request is ambiguous, ask before doing any work.

**Called by the operations, not invoked directly**

[derive-eval-requirements, turns the source document into the three categorised requirement lists](./references/derive-eval-requirements.md)
[design-test-cases, the user journeys and the three test groups](./references/design-test-cases.md)
[tool-catalog, resolves the tools — mcp-mock.json for an agent, extension.yaml and the translation files for an extension](./references/tool-catalog.md)
[validate-and-report, the checklist, coverage measurement, and report — run before writing](./references/validate-and-report.md)

## Paths

**`output_dir` is always the agent's asset folder — `<solution-root>/assets/<asset-name>/`.**
Everything this skill writes goes under it, so `aeval/` lands at
`assets/<asset-name>/aeval/` and nowhere else.

Never derive it from the source document's parent directory, and never write relative to the
current working directory. The PRD is written as `product-requirements-document.md` at the
**solution root**, a sibling of `assets/` — so its parent is the solution root, and taking it
as `output_dir` puts `aeval/` beside `assets/` instead of inside it.

That failure is silent and total. The downstream scorer reads `assets/*/aeval/eval.yaml`; an
`aeval/` folder anywhere else is invisible to it, and it reports zero business-outcome
coverage with the rationale that the skill never ran. The files exist, the run looks healthy,
and nothing scores.

### Resolve it in two steps

**1. Find the solution root.** The folder holding `solution.yaml`. Failing that, the folder
holding `assets/` alongside `product-requirements-document.md`, `intent.md`, or
`specification/`. Given any path inside the solution, walk up until you find it.

**2. Find the agent's asset folder under `assets/`.** Take the first that resolves:

| Rule | |
|---|---|
| The folder whose `asset.yaml` declares `type: agent` or `type: agent-extension` | The normal case. Sibling assets of `type: mcp-server`, `n8n-workflow`, or `data-product` are never the target. |
| The folder containing `mcp-mock.json` | The tool catalog sits at the agent's asset root, so it identifies the folder directly. |
| The asset the source document or the specification names | Use when several agent assets exist. |
| The only folder under `assets/` | Use when there is exactly one. |

`output_dir` is `<solution-root>/assets/<that folder>/`. If no step resolves it — no
`assets/` folder, or several agent assets and nothing choosing between them — **ask rather
than guessing, and never fall back to the solution root.**

Do not create an asset folder to have somewhere to write. If `assets/` holds no agent asset,
the agent has not been scaffolded yet and the evaluation has nothing to describe; say so.

```
<solution-root>/
  product-requirements-document.md   the source — read, never written
  solution.yaml
  aeval-base/                        base agent's assets, extensions only — read, never written
  assets/
    <asset-name>/                    ← output_dir
      asset.yaml
      mcp-mock.json                  the tool catalog — read, never written
      aeval/
        eval.yaml                    the eval requirements    — from the PRD
        testcases/
          <id>.yaml                  one file per test case   — from the PRD
        config.yaml                  runtime parameters       — always the defaults
```

`aeval-base/` is the exception that stays at the solution root: it is the base agent's
shipped baseline, not part of this asset. It is read and never written.

Create `aeval/` and `aeval/testcases/` before writing into them.

Do not confuse `eval.yaml` with `config.yaml` — same directory, unrelated contents, and
neither reader fails loudly when given the other's.

**An `aeval/` folder at the solution root is the old layout.** Read it as the baseline if the
asset folder has none, write the result to `assets/<asset-name>/aeval/`, and say in the
report that the location moved. Never write to the old location, and never leave the run
having written to both.

**Locating `mcp-mock.json`.** Search `{output_dir}/mcp-mock.json` first — that is where it
belongs. Then `<solution-root>/assets/*/mcp-mock.json`, then anywhere under the solution root
excluding paths containing a `.claude/` segment. **Stop at the first hit and use that file as
is.** If none is found, follow the fallback in
[tool-catalog](./references/tool-catalog.md) — never continue with an empty catalog silently.

**Who writes what.** Nothing writes until validation.
`derive-eval-requirements` and `tool-catalog` return their results to the caller; the
operation holds the eval requirements in working memory, frozen before any scenario is
invented and amended as the scenarios surface what the source implied. Only
[validate-and-report](./references/validate-and-report.md) touches the disk, writing
`eval.yaml`, the test cases, and `config.yaml` together once every check has passed.

Requirements are settled before the tests are designed because the order matters — tests
written first would only mirror themselves. That discipline is about the order of reasoning,
not about the filesystem, so it costs nothing to hold them in memory. A run that stops early
then leaves nothing behind, rather than an unvalidated `eval.yaml` that a later run would
find and trust.
